InfirmierMnDar Mobile Application
I am proud to share a significant achievement in the field of digital health. In collaboration with a highly skilled team, we developed InfirmierMnDar, an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize and optimize the management of home nursing services.

Project Objective:
Our mobile application aims to simplify and automate crucial processes such as authentication, registration, user management, and the booking of nursing and medical services.

Key Features:

- Authentication and Authorization: Provides easy login and registration for nurses and patients, including guest login options.
- Nurse Management: Facilitates the registration and profile management for nurses, allows viewing of service requests, and confirms registrations post-verification.
- Patient Services: Enables patients to select and book the best nurses based on the required service categories.
  Technologies Used:

Frontend: Developed using React Native, Expo, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS to ensure a smooth and modern user interface.
Backend: Utilized Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL for robust and efficient data management.
Additional Tools: Employed Postman for API testing and Hibernate for ORM, ensuring effective interaction between system components.
